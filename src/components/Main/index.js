                I fell in love with programming while working in the hospitality
                industry. During that time, I spent my spare time creating
                mobile applications using Java and Swift, eventually diving into
                React Native to write code compatible for both Android and iOS
                devices.

                and endless possibilities. Realizing my true calling, I decided
